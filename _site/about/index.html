<p><p>Hello!</p></p>
<p><p>My name is <strong>Yvanna Cardenas Beltran</strong>.<br>
I am a <strong>Computer Science student</strong> currently enrolled at the <strong>University of California, San Diego, class of June 2026</strong>.<br>
I’m driven into technology because of my <strong>urge to solve problems, teamwork, and developing functional solutions that offer a voice to the community</strong>.</p></p>
<p><p>With a strong foundation in software development, I have further strengthened my skills with courses in <strong>Data Structures, Algorithms, and Computer Architecture</strong>, besides real-world projects.<br>
For instance, I created a <strong>space-themed, interactive Developer Journal web app</strong> for users to organize tasks and reflect on their development, and also an <strong>entertainment recommender app</strong> built with <strong>Flask, AWS, and OpenAI</strong> that enhances decision-making.<br>
These projects have deepened my technical expertise and strengthened my ability to deliver <strong>user-centered solutions</strong>.</p></p>
<p><p>Beyond coding, I thrive in environments that are <strong>truly collaborative</strong>, where ideas are shared, challenges faced as a team, and innovation is made alive.<br>
I pride myself on my <strong>communication, empathy, and positivity</strong> in any team. To me, <strong>strong relationships and a people-first approach are as crucial to success as technical skills</strong>.</p></p>
<p><p>I am passionate about using <strong>technology for creating impact</strong>.<br>
Whether through tools to improve everyday living or systems that attempt to solve <strong>critical challenges</strong>, I aim to build <strong>solutions with impact</strong>.<br>
I am always keen to <strong>learn and grow</strong> in projects that promote <strong>innovation, inclusivity, and community</strong>, as my values align with what drives this movement.</p>
